\paragraph{Version numbering scheme}

In order to track the evolution of the format specification documents the following numbering scheme has been adopted:

\begin{verbatim}
<major version>.<minor version>.<patch version>
  [0..]        .  [0..99]      .  [0..99]
\end{verbatim}
where

\begin{itemize}
\item the \verb|<patch version>| is getting incremented on changes to the document, which do not affect the actual contents of the file (such as when changing attribute names and such), e.g. correcting/augmenting descriptions, adding examples, etc.
\item The \verb|<minor version>| tracks minor changes to the actual content of
  the file, such as renaming, adding or removing attributes.
\item The \verb|<major version>| indicates major changes with in the file format,
  such as reorganization of the internal hierarchical structure or
  official release to the public.
\end{itemize}
